# Hello

![techs](https://img.shields.io/badge/techs-ReactJS-green)

It is a given that applications must provide users with the functionality
necessary to accomplish some task or goal. The effectiveness of app functionality
is the first determinate of how users perceive the apps they use. However, it
is not the only thing that influences user satisfaction.

The User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) features developers build into
apps have at least an equal amount of influence on users perception of an app.
It may be an oversimplification, but UI/UX is largely (but not wholly)
concerned with an apps "form". Personalization is an aspect of UX that tailors
characteristics and actions to
the individual user. Personalizing app functionality in this manner works to
make the app easier and more pleasing to use.

The objective of the Hello app is to leverage geolocation to obtain the users
country so it can then generate a customized greeting in the users native
language.
